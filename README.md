### A note about code coverage
Our tests attempted to cover as much logic as we could in our non-view files, but this proved to be difficult for our Firebase controller. As all of the calls made from the controller connect to the Firestore database, there is a delay in receiving the information. This means that in order to write effective tests for these functions, they need to execute after the calls are completed by the Firebase controller. However, to implement this, it required us to make our controller functions asynchronous, so that we could use the `await` keyword, but this was not possible as the functions are used in other contexts that don't allow this (i.e., a MakeUIView function for MapKit that disallows asynchronous calls). We could also implement a way to manually track if data was received such as using the built-in semaphore tools, but this would be both resource wasteful and ambiguous as we don't know for sure when data is done being transferred.

As a result, we had to leave our Firebase controller alone. The consequence of this is that the results of the tests for Firebase may not seem accurate:
- Sometimes, they do not complete executing as a task is created during another session (i.e., a test begins before another expectation is fulfilled)
- Sometimes, the tests finish execution with high coverage, as the Firebase calls finish executing (highest coverage seen so far: 88%)

However, for the majority of test cases in the FirebaseTests file, the logic is correct. 

Example results (unchanged code):

- Case 1: "task created in a session that has been invalidated" error

- Case 2: High coverage success

## A-level Use Cases
* Onboarding
    * Ability to create a user account with an Andrew ID
* View Meets
    * Ability to see current and future Meets happening around the user
* Host a Meet
    * Ability to create a Meet and make it publicly available
* Join a Meet
    * Ability to join/leave a Meet
* View Ongoing Meets
    * Ability to see current meets happening (the ones being attended by the user)


## B-level Use Cases
- Link Meet Details from popup in map
	- Open meet details from button click in the preview of a meet from the map
- Clustered meets need to be handled properly
	- Meets in the same location are clustered; implement views consistent with a singular meetâ€™s view
- Special views for users of joined meets (exit meet)
	- Options for users viewing joined meets must be different from viewing meets that have not yet joined; include leaving a meet 
- Store users with meets (hosting and joining)
	- Implement a way to track users throughout the app
	- Store users with Meets when hosted or joined
	- Use stored Users to filter information throughout app (i.e., ongoing meets)
- Fix bugs with joining meets and my meets page
	- Fix issues with joining not correctly updating the joined value
	- Improve UI for joining Meets and for viewing ongoing Meets
